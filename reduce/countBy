Challenge 14
Create a function countBy that accepts an array and a callback, and returns an object. countBy will iterate through the array and perform the callback on each element. Each return value from the callback will be saved as a key on the object. The value associated with each key will be the number of times that particular return value was returned.


/ Challenge 14
//input: array, callback()
//output: obj
	//keys: return value from callback 
	//value: num of times that value was returned 
function countBy(array, callback) {
  
  
  return array.reduce((obj,curr) => {
    
    if (callback(curr) in obj === false) {
      obj[callback(curr)] = 1
    } else {
      obj[callback(curr)]++
    }
    
    return obj
    
  },{})
  
  //iterate though the array
  //perform a callback on each item
  //
