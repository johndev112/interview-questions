pluck
Write a function called pluck, which takes an array of objects and the name of a key.

The function should return an array containing the value associated with that key for each object, or undefined if that key is not present in the object.

Examples:



input: array of objs, name of key
output: array containing value of key passed in 

loop though the array using reduce 
/filter obj keys that equal 
loop though oject

function pluck (arr,keyval) {
  return arr.reduce((acc,curr) => {

    for (let key in curr) {
      if (key === keyval) {
            acc.push(curr[key])

      }
	  }
    return acc
  
  }, [])
}

console.log(pluck([
  { name: "Tim" }, { name: "Matt" }, { name: "Elie" }],
 'name'
))
// ["Tim", "Matt", "Elie"]
