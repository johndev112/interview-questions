Question 2b
A group of friends have decided to start a secret society. The name will be the first letter of each of their
names, sorted in alphabetical order. Create a function ‘societyName’ that takes in an array of names and
returns the name of the secret society. For example, if our input is [‘Adam’, ‘Sarah’, ‘Malcolm’] then
‘societyName’ should return the string ‘AMS’
