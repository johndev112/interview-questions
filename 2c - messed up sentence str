//input string 
//return string in title style (each word capitlized)

function fixTitle (str) 
//.split to change into an array
//map to return a new array
//ele[0].toUpperCase to change each element in the array to upper case
// + ele.slice(1) to change each char in the array beside the first char to lower case
//..join to change back int a string 
  let output = str.split(' ').map((ele) => {
    return ele[0].toUpperCase() + ele.slice(1).toLowerCase()
  }).join(' ')
  
  
  return output
}



console.log(fixTitle(example.sentence))
