divideObject
Write a function called divideObject that accepts an object where the values are either strings or numbers. The function should return an array of arrays. The first subarray should contain a total of all of the numbers and the second subarray should contain a number which is the total of all the characters of all the strings.

Examples:

divideObject({
  first: "hi",
  second: "hello",
  third: "hey",
  fourth: 2,
  fifth: "fun",
  sixth: 10,
})
// [ [12], [13] ]
